	<p>Building the online face of Eflyn, a frontrunner in the design and manufacture of next-generation digital display, self checkout kiosks, and automation technologies was a mission-critical project. My role was not only to design but also to develop an end-to-end website that effectively showcases Eflyn's innovative product offerings and supports essential business functions such as marketing, branding, customer acquisition, and product knowledge presentation.</p>

	<p>This project involved:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Creating a fully custom-built Bootstrap 3 theme with hundreds of bespoke components tailored for a wide range of needs.</li>
		<li>Integrating various content management systems and APIs for a seamless user experience.</li>
		<li>Designing and developing a custom kiosk preview generator that automatically maps sample media to hundreds of kiosk models, allowing customers to visualize potential kiosk solutions effortlessly.</li>
		<li>Putting in place thorough testing and development mechanisms to ensure optimal site speed and performance.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>It was not only about delivering a website; it was about crafting a digital identity that resonates with Eflyn's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. Reflecting back, I am proud of what we accomplished.</p>
