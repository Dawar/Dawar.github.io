	<p>Wayfinding applications are an integral part of modern indoor and outdoor advertising kiosks. Eflyn's next-generation wayfinding application, which I had the privilege of building, offers a plethora of features designed to ensure an efficient and enjoyable user experience.</p>

	<p>The goal was to ensure that the application was as intuitive and user-friendly as possible, negating the need for a manual or extensive explanations. To accomplish this, we used the initial wayfinding application I built for Ryerson University as a foundation and included several new and enhanced features such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Point-to-point animated directions and interactive digital maps for clear navigation.</li>
		<li>Automated pathfinding to guide users via the most optimal route and shortcuts to popular locations.</li>
		<li>A fast search system capable of handling thousands of listings.</li>
		<li>Separate accessibility routes, multi-floor navigation, and digital signage banner space.</li>
		<li>Integration of digital signage advertising, mobile handoff of maps and directions via QR code, and an improved pathfinding algorithm.</li>
		<li>A unified back end where clients can manage listings and map directions on their own.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>Working on this project, I learned the importance of designing with the end user in mind and the value of integrating features that are not just innovative, but also practical and beneficial for the client. This application is now being used by countless visitors to easily navigate around locations such as airports, shopping malls, hotels, hospitals, university campuses, and office complexes. It is rewarding to know that something I helped create is making people's lives easier.</p>
