	<p>Ensuring security and efficiency in payment processing for kiosks is paramount. My objective was to develop a Unified Payment Solution to interface with multiple payment processors, providing a reliable and secure method of processing payments in Eflyn kiosks.</p>
	<br>
	<blockquote>"We are moving toward a world where everything that can be connected will be connected â€” where every payment will be digital, every purchase will be mobile." - Howard Schultz</blockquote>
	<br>
	<p>This project involved:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Writing the initial payment hardware integrations for Eflyn kiosks and apps.</li>
		<li>Developing a Unified Payment Solution that encapsulates existing and future payment integrations.</li>
		<li>Designing a generic interface for the payment system to be used by third-party developers through easy-to-use SDKs and APIs.</li>
		<li>Integrating a wide variety of payment processing partners including Global Payments, Clover, TSYS / Cayan, TD Merchant Solutions, Moneris, Stripe, and TouchNet OneCard.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>This system not only enhanced the security of payment processing in Eflyn kiosks but also significantly streamlined the payment integration process. I am proud to have played a central role in developing this critical aspect of Eflyn's service offering.</p>
