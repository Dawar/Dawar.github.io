	<p>Recognizing the potential of Shopify's booming POS system, I developed the Self Checkout for Shopify app, an innovative solution that merges the convenience of self-checkout kiosks with the robust functionality of Shopify.</p>
	<br>
	<blockquote>"The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else." - Eric Ries</blockquote>
	<br>
	<p>This project involved:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Conceptualizing and developing a comprehensive self-checkout system that integrates seamlessly with Shopify.</li>
		<li>Automating syncing for products, collections, discounts, and orders.</li>
		<li>Supporting multiple checkout modes, including Scan 'n' Go, Pickup, and Delivery.</li>
		<li>Integrating with Eflyn Digital Signage application.</li>
		<li>Configuring various behaviors related to fulfillment, inventory deduction, and more.</li>
		<li>Creating intuitive automated menus from Shopify collections and enabling store-wide search.</li>
		<li>Supporting multiple checkouts on one kiosk.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>The Self Checkout for Shopify app was built custom on the Kiosk Platform using Node.js and MongoDB and integrates with Shopify via multiple APIs. The success of this application affirms my belief in the value of merging powerful platforms to create seamless and convenient customer experiences.</p>
