	<p>Building on Eflyn's decade-long experience with kiosk apps, I developed the Kiosk Developer Platform. This tool allows developers to create custom kiosk apps, leveraging our established platform and proven technologies.</p>

	<blockquote>"The ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones that do." - Steve Jobs</blockquote>
	<br>
	<p>This project involved:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Building a fully secured Kiosk Desktop runtime for powerful custom apps.</li>
		<li>Providing easy access to Kiosk APIs and SDKs, enabling developers to use kiosk-specific functions, such as printing receipts, processing payments, scanning barcodes, and more.</li>
		<li>Making Eflyn's expertise and extensive documentation available to developers.</li>
		<li>Facilitating integration of custom kiosk apps with Eflyn Kiosk apps for enhanced functionalities.</li>
		<li>Enabling automatic analytics for kiosk apps and remote management of kiosk machines.</li>
		<li>Offering accessibility mode and control over app deployment.</li>
		<li>Building multiple Node.JS microservices and developing fully typed APIs and SDKs in Typescript.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Creating the Kiosk Developer Platform from scratch was a challenging yet rewarding process. It involved understanding the needs of developers, conceptualizing solutions, and finally implementing these solutions in a way that makes the task of developing custom kiosk apps easier, faster, and more efficient. Reflecting back, I am proud of this accomplishment.</p>
