	<p>One of my significant involvements with Eflyn was the development of the flagship product, the 32" Self Order Kiosk. This project demanded a deep dive into product design, requiring involvement in 3D rendering, material selection, hardware components, and electrical safety.</p>
	<br>
	<blockquote>"Design is a balance between form and function... it takes two." - Seesaw</blockquote>
	<br>
	<p>This project involved:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Creating realistic 3D renderings to visualize the final product and its fit in potential use scenarios.</li>
		<li>Choosing materials with the perfect blend of durability, aesthetics, and cost-effectiveness.</li>
		<li>Selecting hardware components that would ensure seamless functionality, reliability, and longevity of the kiosk.</li>
		<li>Ensuring the electrical safety of the product, making it not only efficient but also safe for use in various environments.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>Contributing to the design and development of Eflyn's flagship product was a challenging but fulfilling experience. It was an opportunity to delve into the complexities of hardware product design and witness the product come to life from a mere idea. Reflecting back, I am proud of our accomplishment and its continued success in the market.</p>
