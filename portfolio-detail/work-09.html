	<p>Working with the Planaday team, I was integral in designing, developing, and deploying their first Guest Experience Kiosk. This transformative technology is now deployed in the top tourism markets globally and serves thousands of customers daily. This project involved an array of challenges including UX design, web application development, kiosk hardware integration, and in-person payment integration.</p>
