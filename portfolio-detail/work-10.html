	<p>Prior to my foray into software development, I specialized in graphic design, motion graphics, and video production. I have produced hundreds of videos that demonstrate software features and hardware products. For these videos, I would write scripts to communicate the essential ideas behind the product and then conceptualize a live or animated video that best communicates those ideas.</p>
	<br>
	<blockquote>"Animation is not the art of drawings that move but the art of movements that are drawn." - Norman McLaren</blockquote>
	<br>
	<p>Some of the videos I've created include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Self Checkout Kiosk for Shopify: A comprehensive guide showcasing the unique features and usability of the Self Checkout Kiosk for Shopify.</li>
		<li>Various Training Videos for Eflyn Software and Hardware: These videos serve as a user-friendly guide for the employees and clients to understand the workings of Eflyn's offerings.</li>
		<li>Product Advertisements: These videos capture the salient features of a product in a captivating and concise manner, making it easier for the potential customers to understand the product better.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>My videos not only serve the purpose of highlighting the features of a product but also tell a compelling story that resonates with the audience. I believe that a well-structured and engaging video can significantly enhance the understanding of a product and can contribute to its overall success.</p>
